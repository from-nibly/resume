# About Me

I've spent my whole career, heck, probably whole life, trying to make processes
better.

I remember when I was about 8 years old my mom had bought about 30 large
packages of diapers on sale. While my mom was bringing them in I spent the
entire time devising a way to string together a bunch of large party coolers so
we could pull them into the house all at once like a big train. While I still
have the same drive to keep improving my situation I am a lot more dicerning
with what I spend my time on.

I love to read books about how to do things efficiently. My three favorite books
right now are [The Lean Startup](/books-i-love#the-lean-startup) by Eric Ries,
[OKRs Measure What Matters](/books-i-love#okrs-measure-what-matters) by John
Doerr, and
[Grit: The Power of Passion and Perserverance](/books-i-love#grit-the-power-of-passion-and-perserverance)
by Angela Duckworth. These books show what's possible in an individual and in an
organization with careful planning.

I have the most fun when I can enable developers to contribute more freely and,
to steal a line from John Doerr, "Focus on what matters most" (Writing cool
software). In this day and age there are many tools that can help or hurt this
goal depending on how they are implemented.

Are you looking to make your development organization a
[Theme Park Experience](/notes/theme-park-experience)? I want to help. Together
we can make your company a great place to work.
