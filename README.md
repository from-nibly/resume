# About Me

I've spent my whole career, heck, probably whole life, trying to make processes
better.

I remember when I was about 8 years old my mom had bought about 30 large
packages of diapers on sale. While my mom was bringing them in I spent the
entire time devising a way to string together a bunch of large party coolers so
we could pull them into the house all at once like a big train. While I still
have the same drive to keep improving my situation I am a lot more discerning
with what I spend my time on.

I love to read books about how to do things effectively. My three favorite books
right now are [The Goal](/books-i-love#the-goal) by Eli Goldratt,
[Decluttering At the Speed of Life](/books-i-love#decluttering-at-the-speed-of-life)
by Dana K. White, and
[Shipping Creative work](/books-i-love#grit-the-power-of-passion-and-perserverance)
by Seth Godin. These books and all the books I read help me craft language to
describe how to improve the world.

I have the most fun when I can enable developers to contribute more freely and,
Focus on what matters; delivering value to the customer. Every day this gets
harder and harder for developers, but I believe it's possible to reverse this
trend.

Are you looking to make your development organization a
[Theme Park Experience](/notes/theme-park-experience)? I want to help. Together
we can make your company a great place to work.
