# Product VS Project

Working on a project is a lot like building a house. You can only build one at a
time. Each time you build a house you have the potential to get better and
faster, but you also have the opportunity to make mistakes. You can make the
same mistakes over and over again. You can even make mistakes on things that you
did perfectly the last time you built a house. The way to make your situation
better is to make yourself more disciplined and focused but that can fail you if
you are tired or distracted.

Creating a product is like building a factory. Every time you create a widget it
comes out the same. If there is a problem with the machine all of the widgets
will be created with a defect and it will be easier to figure out where the
problem is. If you fix the problem, you fix all future widgets. The work you do
on the machine has a multiplicative effect on the output.

Software development can be either one. When software development is treated
like a project it becomes unstable and requires a lot of manual effort outside
of writing the actual code. When software development is treated like a product
the main focus can remain on features and code quality. (see also
[Theme Park Experience](/notes/theme-park-experience)). A lot of this comes down
to the tools surrounding your process. I enjoy building tools, refining
processes, and establishing cultures that facilitate a product mindset within
software development organizations.
