# The California Gold Rush

In 1894, California experienced what we now call the "Gold Rush". The quote on
my cover page refers to the difference in strategy between different enterprises
and how they turned out. There are two main camps: the prospectors, and the
companies that sold "shovels". "Shovels" really refers to the supplies, tools,
etc. that enabled the prospectors to do their job. The companies that "made
shovels" ended up making the most money, and had a more stable business model.
Levi Strauss, who sold blue jeans to prospectors, was one of the biggest
successes from the "Gold Rush".

## What's your point?

I like enabling other people to write great software. It's not the most
glamorous, but for me it's the most satisfying. When writing tools, building
systems, or designing processes (making shovels), for people I work with I get
extremely quick feedback (good or bad), and can act on that. I love making
peoples lives easier, and I love programming, so I especially love making
programmers lives easier.
